# AI test riddle Sally - and 'Simple Sally'
2023-12-13- the Mixtral models (GGUF) have been loaded with llama.cpp configured following the guide here : https://github.com/nktice/AMD-AI/blob/main/Mixtral.md


# Question 1:
I saw this question on a post on reddit and thought it was worth trying...
`"Sally (a girl) has 3 brothers. Each brother has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?"`

These settings appear important to get things to work so they are default:
exllama [loader] : max_seq_len 4096, compress_pos_emb 4

cc_Dolphin3.0-Llama3.1-8B - [ Fail ] 
"Since Sally has 3 brothers, and each brother has 2 sisters, we can calculate the total number of sisters as follows: Each brother has 2 sisters, so the 3 brothers together have 3 x 2 = 6 sisters. However, this includes all sisters, not just Sally's sisters. Since Sally herself is one of the sisters (as she has brothers), we must subtract her from the total count to find her direct sisters. Therefore, Sally has 6 - 1 = 5 sisters."

"Let's break it down the information given: Sally has 3 brothers, and each of those brothers has 2 sisters, who would include Sally herself. So, the 2 sisters are the same for all the brothers. Therefore, Sally has 2 sisters in total, including herself, making her one of them."

Qwen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct - [ pass ] 
"Let's break down the problem:  Sally has 3 brothers. Each of these 3 brothers has 2 sisters. Since Sally is one of the sisters, the other sister must be the only one shared sister among all the brothers. Therefore, Sally and her sister are the two sisters.  So, Sally has 1 sister."
