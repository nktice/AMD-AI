## Install notes / instructions / changelog ##

2025-09-17 - Started new draft for Ubunutu 24.04.3 / ROCm 7 ...
Note that this is work in progress - please wait until this message is removed before following. 

--------


# Ubuntu 22.04 / 23.04 / 23.10 / 24.04 - Base system install 
Ubuntu 22.04 works great on Radeon 6900 XT video cards, 
but does not support 7900XTX cards as they came out later 
Ubuntu 23.04 is newer but has issues with some of the tools... 
note there's one command to include the old system that solves such issues. 
Ubuntu 23.10 - also generally working... 
Ubuntu 24.04 - now works too... note comments. 

At this point we assume you've done the system install
and you know what that is, have a user, root, etc. 

```bash
# update system packages 
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y 
```

```bash 
#turn on devel and sources.
sudo apt-add-repository -y -s -s
sudo apt install -y "linux-headers-$(uname -r)" \
	"linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)"
```

#### [ for Ubuntu 23.04, 23.10, and 24.04 ... ]
Some things may require various old packages so we need to add
jammy packages, so that they can be installed, on lunar systems.
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y -s deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy main universe
```

#### [ For Ubuntu 24.04 ... ] 
This allows calls to older versions of Python by using "deadsnakes" 
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y
sudo apt update -y 
```

## Add AMD GPU package sources 
Make the directory if it doesn't exist yet.
This location is recommended by the distribution maintainers.

```bash
sudo mkdir --parents --mode=0755 /etc/apt/keyrings
```

Download the key, convert the signing-key to a full
Keyring required by apt and store in the keyring directory
```bash
wget https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key -O - | \
    gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg > /dev/null
```
amdgpu repository for jammy
```bash
echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu/7.0.1/ubuntu jammy main' \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/amdgpu.list
sudo apt update -y 
```

AMDGPU DKMS
```bash
sudo apt install -y amdgpu-dkms
```
Note : This commonly produces warning message about 'Possible missing firmware' these are just wanrings and things work anyway, they can be ignored. 

# ROCm repositories for jammy
https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/os-native/install.html

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/7.0.1/ jammy main" \
    | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list
echo -e 'Package: *\nPin: release o=repo.radeon.com\nPin-Priority: 600' \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/rocm-pin-600
sudo apt update -y
```

# More AMD ROCm related packages 
This is lots of stuff, but comparatively small so worth including,
as some stuff later may want as dependencies without much notice.
```bash
# ROCm...
# RIP rocm-dkms
# sudo apt install -y rocm-dev rocm-libs rocm-hip-sdk rocm-dkms rocm-libs
sudo apt install -y rocm-dev rocm-libs rocm-hip-sdk rocm-libs
```


```bash
# ld.so.conf update 
sudo tee --append /etc/ld.so.conf.d/rocm.conf <<EOF
/opt/rocm/lib
/opt/rocm/lib64
EOF
sudo ldconfig
```

```bash
# update path
echo "PATH=/opt/rocm/bin:/opt/rocm/opencl/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.profile
```

## Find graphics device
```bash
sudo /opt/rocm/bin/rocminfo | grep gfx
```
Found : gfx1030 [ Radeon 6900 ]
Found : gfx1100 [ Radeon 7900 ] 

## Add user to groups
Of course note to change the user name to match your user. 
```bash
sudo adduser `whoami` video
sudo adduser `whoami` render
```

```bash
# git and git-lfs (large file support
sudo apt install -y git git-lfs
# development tool may be required later...
sudo apt install -y libstdc++-12-dev
# stable diffusion likes TCMalloc...
sudo apt install -y libtcmalloc-minimal4
```

## Performance Tuning
This section is optional, and as such has been moved to [performance-tuning](https://github.com/nktice/AMD-AI/blob/main/performance-tuning.md)

## Top for video memory and usage
nvtop 
Note : I have had issues with the distro version crashes with 2 GPUs, installing new version from sources works fine.  Instructions for that are included at the bottom, as they depend on things installed between here and there.   Project website : https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop 
```bash
sudo apt install -y nvtop 
```

## Radeon specific tools...
```bash
sudo apt install -y radeontop rovclock
```

## and now we reboot...
```bash
sudo reboot
```

## End of OS / base setup

--------
2025-09-17 - the following is Untested yet with new configuration.


# Stable Diffusion (Automatic1111) 
This system is built to use its own venv ( rather than Conda )...

## Download Stable Diffusion ( Automatic1111 webui ) 
https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
Get the files...
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git
cd stable-diffusion-webui
```

# Requisites : 
Automatic1111 / Stable Diffusion doesn't work with newer versions of python, so we specify one it works with. 
```bash
sudo apt install -y wget git python3.10 python3.10-venv libgl1
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3.10 -m pip install -U pip
deactivate
```

## Edit environment settings...
```bash
tee --append webui-user.sh <<EOF
# specify compatible python version
python_cmd="python3.10"
 ## Torch for ROCm
# generic import...
# export TORCH_COMMAND="pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly"
# workaround for ROCm + Torch > 2.4.x - https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/3698
 export TORCH_BLAS_PREFER_HIPBLASLT=0
# use specific versions to avoid downloading all the nightlies... ( update dates as needed )
# Note that torchvision sometimes needs the previous night's version of torch, so their dates are sequential
 export TORCH_COMMAND="pip install --pre torch==2.10.0.dev20250916+rocm6.4 torchvision==0.25.0.dev20250917+rocm6.4 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.4"
 ## And if you want to call this from other programs...
 export COMMANDLINE_ARGS="--api"
 ## crashes with 2 cards, so to get it to run on the second card (only), unremark the following 
 # export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1"
EOF
```


## If you keep models for SD somewhere, this is where you'd like them up...
If you don't do this, it will install a default to get you going. 
Note that these start files do include things that it needs you'll want to copy
into the folder where you have other models ( to avoid issues ) 
```bash
#mv models models.1
#ln -s /path/to/models models 
```

## Run SD...
 Note that the first time it starts it may take it a while to go and get things
 it's not always good about saying what it's up to. 
```bash
./webui.sh 
```

The first time this is run it will install the requirements.  May take a few tries for it to get everything the way it likes it. 


## end Stable Diffusion

# ComfyUI install script 
- variation of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager/main/scripts/install-comfyui-venv-linux.sh 
Includes ComfyUI-Manager

Install of packages like for Stable Diffusion ( included here in case you're not installed SD and just want ComfyUI... ) - but it's not bothered by Python 3.12... 
```bash
sudo apt install -y wget git python3.10 python3.10-venv libgl1 
```

```bash
cd 
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager
cd ..
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3.10 -m pip install -U pip 
## pre-install torch and torchvision from nightlies - note you may want to update versions... 
# python3.10 -m pip install --pre torch==2.5.0.dev20240704+rocm6.1 torchvision==0.20.0.dev20240704+rocm6.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.1
# python3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.1
##
## Note the following manually includes the contents of requirements.txt - because otherwise attempting to install the requirements goes and reinstalls torch over again. 
python3.10 -m pip install --pre torch==2.10.0.dev20250916+rocm6.4 torchvision==0.25.0.dev20250917+rocm6.4  torchsde torchaudio einops transformers>=4.25.1 safetensors>=0.4.2 aiohttp pyyaml Pillow scipy tqdm psutil av  --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.4

python3.10 -m pip install -r custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.4

# end vend if needed...
deactivate
```

Scripts for running the program...
Note that " TORCH_BLAS_PREFER_HIPBLASLT=0 " is needed as explained here - https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/3698

```bash
# run_gpu.sh
tee --append run_gpu.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/bash
source venv/bin/activate
TORCH_BLAS_PREFER_HIPBLASLT=0 python3.10 main.py --preview-method auto
EOF
chmod +x run_gpu.sh

#run_cpu.sh
tee --append run_cpu.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/bash
source venv/bin/activate
TORCH_BLAS_PREFER_HIPBLASLT=0 python3.10 main.py --preview-method auto --cpu
EOF
chmod +x run_cpu.sh
```

Update the config file to point to Stable Diffusion (presuming it's installed...)
```bash
# config file - connecto stable-diffusion-webui 
cp extra_model_paths.yaml.example extra_model_paths.yaml
sed -i "s@path/to@`echo ~`@g" extra_model_paths.yaml
# edit config file to point to your checkpoints etc 
#vi extra_model_paths.yaml
```

## End ComfyUI install

## Conda
First we'll need Conda ... Required for pytorch... Conda provides virtual environments for python, so that programs with different dependencies can have different environments.
Here is more info on managing conda : https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#

## Oobabooga / Textgen webui 
- https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui

```bash
conda create -n textgen python=3.11 -y
conda activate textgen
```



### bitsandbytes rocm 
2024-04-24 - AMD's own ROCm version of bitsandbytes has been updated! - https://github.com/ROCm/bitsandbytes  ( ver 0.44.0.dev0 at time of writing ) 
```bash
# conda activate textgen
cd
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/bitsandbytes.git
cd bitsandbytes
pip install .
```


## Oobabooga / Text-generation-webui - Install webui...
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui
cd text-generation-webui
```

Models 
If you're new to this - new models can be downloaded from the shell via a python script, or from a form in the interface.
There are lots of them - http://huggingface.co 
Generally the GPTQ models by TheBloke are likely to load... https://huggingface.co/TheBloke  The 30B/33B models will load on 24GB of VRAM, but may error, or run out of memory depending on usage and parameters.  
Worthy of mention, TurboDerp ( author of the exllama loaders ) has been posting exllamav2 ( exl2 ) processed versions of models - https://huggingface.co/turboderp ( for use with exllamav2 loader ) - when downloading, note the --branch option.  

To get new models note the ~/text-generation-webui directory has a program " download-model.py " that is made for downloading models from HuggingFace's collection.  

If you have old models,  link pre-stored models into the models
```bash
# cd ~/text-generation-webui
# mv models models.1
# ln -s /path/to/models models
```


### Many things have changed so we're trying to use Oobabooga's installer 
- it now uses Vulkan instead of ROCm... so some of the previous instructions may be redundant... working on it. 
```bash
sudo apt install curl
./start_linux.sh 
```
